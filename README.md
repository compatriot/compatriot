Compatriot
==========

**Compat**ibility + **riot**! It's the *friend** that helps with browser compatibility!
This Ruby gem makes cross-browser testing less painful.
It's goal is to help identify pages that appear to have significant variations when rendered in different browsers.
You can spend your time fixing the cross-browser problems rather than looking for them.
Don't let your users find the inconsistencies and get to them first.


What it does now
----------------

* Goes to the root path of a Rack app in firefox and chrome and takes a screenshot in each.
* Stores the screenshot in `tmp/results/_timestamp_/_browser_/`
* Creates `tmp/results/_timestamp_/index.html` that shows thumbnails of each screenshot plus a diff of the two in a table for easy comparison.


What it will do in the future
-----------------------------

* Have documentation
* Have a screenshot of sample results in the README
* Have unit tests and better tests
* Be on travis-ci
* Not have a diff that's a different size than the originals
* Find the largest, darkest contiguous region in the image diff and have a threshold of pass/fail based on that
* Perform better on the image processing (by sampling/resizing, using oily_png, etc)
* Given a list of URLs/paths to visit, will take a screenshot of each and display which URL it came from in the index
* Given a test command that uses capybara, runs those tests and takes screenshots
* Automatically compare the screenshots across browsers and flags those that are more than some configurable threshold different
* Allow configuration of which browsers to use
* Connect to virtual machines so that you don't have to have all the browsers on the machine you're running the tests on


How To Use
----------

**Requirements**
1. Ruby v1.9.2
1. [Firefox]() vX.Y
2. [chromedriver](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver) vX.Y.Z

When you run a file similar to the examples it will save results in `_current-directory_/tmp/results/_timestamp_/_browser_`


What to do to run its tests
---------------------------

Using at least ruby 1.9.2:

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake test

This is using minispec for testing.
